# MuJoCo Playground

![Banner for playground](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/blob/main/assets/banner.png?raw=true)

A comprehensive suite of GPU-accelerated environments for robot learning research and sim-to-real, built with [MuJoCo MJX](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/mjx).

Features include:

- Classic control environments from `dm_control` reimplemented in MJX.
- Quadruped and bipedal locomotion environments.
- Non-prehensile and dexterous manipulation environments.
- Vision-based support available via [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx).

For more details, check out the project [website](https://playground.mujoco.org/).

## Installation

### From Source
1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), a faster alternative to `pip`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment: 
    ``` 
    git clone -b test https://yursds/mujoco_playground.git && cd mujoco_playground
    uv venv --python 3.11 
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install dependecies: 
    ```
    uv pip install -e .[all]
    uv pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"
    ```
    * Verify GPU backend: `python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend())"` should print gpu
    * Verify installation (and download Menagerie): `python -c "import mujoco_playground"`

### Reproducibility / GPU Precision Issues
Users with NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs (e.g., RTX 30 and 40 series) may experience reproducibility [issues](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/issues/86) in mujoco_playground due to JAXâ€™s default use of TF32 for matrix multiplications. This lower precision can adversely affect RL training stability. To ensure consistent behavior with systems using full float32 precision (as on Turing GPUs), please run `export JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION=highest` in your terminal before starting your experiments (or add it to the end of `~/.bashrc`).

## Running from CLI
For basic usage, navigate to the repo's directory and run:
```bash
python learning/train_jax_ppo.py --env_name CartpoleBalance
```

### Training Visualization

To interactively view trajectories throughout training with [rscope](https://github.com/Andrew-Luo1/rscope/tree/main), install it (`uv pip install rscope`) and run:

```
python learning/train_jax_ppo.py --env_name PandaPickCube --rscope_envs 16 --run_evals=False --deterministic_rscope=True
# In a separate terminal
python -m rscope
```
