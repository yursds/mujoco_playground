# MuJoCo Playground

<h1>
  <a href="#"><img alt="MuJoCo Playground" src="assets/banner.png" width="100%"></a>
</h1>

A comprehensive suite of GPU-acclerated environments for robot learning research and sim-to-real, accelerated by [MuJoCo MJX](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/mjx).

Features include:

- Classic control environments from `dm_control` reimplemented in MJX.
- Quadruped and bipedal locomotion environments.
- Non-prehensile and dexterous manipulation environments.
- Vision-based support via [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx).

## Installation

### From PyPI

Install from PyPI is as easy as:

```sh
pip install playground
```

### From Source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires Python 3.9 or later.

1. `pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"`
    * Verify GPU backend: python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend())" should print gpu
2. `git clone git@github.com:google-deepmind/mujoco_playground.git`
3. `cd mujoco_playground`
4. `uv pip install -e ".[all]"`

#### Madrona-MJX (optional)

For vision-based environments, follow the installation instructions on the [Madrona-MJX](https://github.com/shacklettbp/madrona_mjx?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) repository.

## Getting started

To try out MuJoCo Playground locally on a simple locomotion environment, run the following:

```py
import jax
import jax.numpy as jp
from mujoco_playground import registry

env = registry.load('Go1JoystickFlatTerrain')
state = jax.jit(env.reset)(jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
print(state.obs)
state = jax.jit(env.step)(state, jp.zeros(env.action_size))
print(state.obs)
```
